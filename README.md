# ViDi2
ViDi2 is the old ViDi in a new form to include non image tests (as blood assays) or planar images.
- A new GUI is to be designed to make use more intuitive.
- Also the whole database structure has to be redefined.

###DONE:
Manages Patient, treatment, sessions and dosimetries tables


###TODO:

There is much code repeated in database tree. Can it be simplified?

Add a method field in dosimetry (may de elsewhere) to calculate after phantom or S-voxel...
###BUGS:
11/05/18 (corrected): Forms changes detection
14/05/18 (detected): Forms update when no changes made don't disable fields
